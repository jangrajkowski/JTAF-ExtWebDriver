Building
=========
ExtWebDriver uses Maven for build. Please install Maven by downloading it [here](http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi).
```sh
# Clone ExtWebDriver git repo
git clone git://github.com/FINRAOS/JTAF-ExtWebDriver.git
cd JTAF-ExtWebDriver

# Run package to compile and create jar
mvn package
```

Running Tests
==============
ExtWebDriver uses Maven plugins to execute both the unit and integration tests. The integration tests run against a locally deployed app (using Jetty server) using HtmlUnitDriver. You can run all of the tests by executing:
```sh
mvn verify
```
You can run individual tests by executing it from your IDE or through command line. If you want to run an integration test, you need to deploy the app locally first before execution.
